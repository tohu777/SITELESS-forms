# SITELESS-forms
Blender/Python recreations of forms from Fran√ßois Blanciak's book SITELESS: 1001 Building Forms (MIT Press, 2008)

This is a modest attempt to recreate just a selection of forms taken from Blanciak's SITELESS book, using Python in Blender.

The forms in the book are simple in description and concept (almost all described in only two words), but somewhat complex as 3D models. But as with the forms in the book, this code is meant to be a basic, axiomatic jumping-off point for further mutation, combination, recombination, extension, etc.
